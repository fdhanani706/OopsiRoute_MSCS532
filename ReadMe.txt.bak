#OopsiRoute — Proof of Concept (Phase 2)

#Project Overview
**OopsiRoute** is a navigation system that demonstrates the use of data structures and algorithms for route optimization.  
This project focuses on applying Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to find the most efficient route between two nodes in a weighted graph.

This proof of concept (PoC) is implemented using Pytho simulating how navigation systems determine shortest paths efficiently in real-world scenarios.
